These are a bunch of files that contain the code im writing when im learning Web Dev. 
It may look too basic n ridiculous to you.  Dont take it seriouslty.

Currently im on this course by Colt Steele. https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp
Besides that, I also use various open-source resources like freecodecamp.org.
